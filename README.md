Random HS programs

Hey! This is Alveera Munshi, and this repo is full of my programs from highschool courses APCSA and CS21.
All problems were gotten from Ms. Melissa Burdge for CS21 and Ms. Alexandria Robles for APCSA. These are simply my solutions to the given prompts.

If you are a student from my school, SBHS, please do not use the following programs to cheat. 
I have them on this repo so that I can store my files between devices if necessary and also because I like feeling accountable for my work.
If you do decide to look at them, please use them simply for practice and checking purposes.

To get around this repo, choose the folder of the respective course you would like to view, then choose the folder corresponding to the topic of choice. The java files with code are stored in files, while the class files are stored in classes.

Regardless of your identity, glad to see you here :))
Have fun looking at my classwork ig LOL!
