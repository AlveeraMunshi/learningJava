Random HS programs

Hey! This is Alveera Munshi, and this repo is full of my programs from coursework.
All problems are the property of South Brunswick High School or Rutgers University.

To get around this repo, choose the folder of the respective course you would like to view, then choose the folder corresponding to the topic of choice. The java files with code are stored in files, while the class files are stored in classes.

I do not condone cheating of any kind, current students should stay off of this repository.
